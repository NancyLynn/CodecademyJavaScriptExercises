This repository contains the work I did as part of Codecademy's "Intro to JavaScript" course. 

After completing the course, I went through every lesson and copied the code I'd written or worked with and pasted it into one or more .js files using Atom. 

I did this both to save the work for refence and to have a collection of files to work with for learning how to use git.
